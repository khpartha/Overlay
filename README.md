# AI Eye Overlay Project â€“ Real-Time Face Feature Augmentation
This project demonstrates a lightweight real-time AI face augmentation system that uses a standard webcam to detect human facial landmarks and apply custom eye overlays dynamically.
The system is built using Python, leveraging MediaPipe for facial landmark detection and OpenCV for real-time image processing and blending.

# Project Goals 
  - Detect a user's face and track key facial features (specifically the eyes) in real-time.
  - Overlay a custom-designed eye image over both the left and right eyes, automatically resizing and aligning them based on face position and size.
  - Ensure smooth visual blending using alpha transparency for a natural and responsive effect.
