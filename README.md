# AI Eye Overlay Project â€“ Real-Time Face Feature Augmentation
This project demonstrates a lightweight real-time AI face augmentation system that uses a standard webcam to detect human facial landmarks and apply custom eye overlays dynamically.
The system is built using Python, leveraging MediaPipe for facial landmark detection and OpenCV for real-time image processing and blending.
