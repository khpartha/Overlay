# AI Eye Overlay Project – Real-Time Face Feature Augmentation
This project demonstrates a lightweight real-time AI face augmentation system that uses a standard webcam to detect human facial landmarks and apply custom eye overlays dynamically.
The system is built using Python, leveraging MediaPipe for facial landmark detection and OpenCV for real-time image processing and blending.

# Project Goals 
  - Detect a user's face and track key facial features (specifically the eyes) in real-time.
  - Overlay a custom-designed eye image over both the left and right eyes, automatically resizing and aligning them based on face position and size.
  - Ensure smooth visual blending using alpha transparency for a natural and responsive effect.

# Technologies Used
  - Python 3.10
  - OpenCV – For webcam access, image resizing, and pixel-level processing
  - MediaPipe FaceMesh – For high-precision facial landmark detection (468 points)
  - PNG image input – Custom eye designs with optional transparency
